My team developed a game where the user has to traverse across the screen and collect as many coins as they can in a certain amount of time. At the end of the timer, the user is then asked to select a red or blue coin in which their selection will determine the outcome of the game. The winner is determined by final coin picked (Red or Blue) and it did not take me and my partner that long to create this game. 

It was made using turtle graphics in python and the character model and coins were made by my partner Beau Perez. Besides that, the background was pulled off of the internet. I coded most of the games basic movement mechanics, UI, and timer. Overall, I was responsible for most of the coding aspects of this project while my partner gathered and made all of the models for the character, objects, and background.

From this project, I mostly learned how to use turtle graphics to create a game with python overall. It was only my second game ever in this language and this was my first coding class so this project was a fun and informing experience. Furthermore, my first game I made did not work, so it was refreshing to finally make a game that could actually run as intended.
