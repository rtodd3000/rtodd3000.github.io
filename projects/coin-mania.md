summary: "My team developed a game where the user has to traverse across the screen and collect as many coins as they can in a certain amount of time. At the end of the timer, the user is then asked to select a red or blue coin in which their selection will determine the outcome of the game."

The winner is determined by final coin picked (Red or Blue) and it did not take me and my partner that long to create this game.
