summary: "My team developed a game where the user has to traverse across the screen and collect as many coins as they can in a certain amount of time. At the end of the timer, the user is then asked to select a red or blue coin in which their selection will determine the outcome of the game."

The winner is determined by final coin picked (Red or Blue) and it did not take me and my partner that long to create this game. It was made using turtle graphics in python and the character model and coins were made by my partner Beau Perez. Besides that, the background was pulled off of the internet.
I coded most of the games basic movement mechanics, UI, and timer.
