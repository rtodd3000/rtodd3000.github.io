Before making this project, I had no idea what the spoons game was. Unfortunately, this made the process of making the game a bit harder since me and my teammates had to research and learn how to play spoons, but once we got it down, everything else came into play. Initializing all the classes for the deck, dealer, cards, etc. was simple and did not take that long for us to do, however the implementation for the game class was very tricky and it took us a lot of trial and error until we were able to get it running.
For this project, I worked a lot on the deck and card classes while me and my two other group members worked on the game class together.
