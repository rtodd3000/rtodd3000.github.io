We have never heard of a concept where a program creates a playlist for you based on your current emotions, so we decided that Emotify would be a fun and innovative project to code. It gives the user the option to let their computers take the wheel and recommend them songs based on their current moods. It gives a playlist of usually around 10 songs and allows users to discover music in different genres that they may have never heard before. The possibilities are endless and I encourage many people to try it out! This was our first project working with computer vision, so creating a project while also learning how to code it all was a fun challenge to face. Another result that came out of our unfamiliarity with the topic was that we all worked on the same parts simultaneously, meaning we did not have a specified coder for the front-end or back-end.
For this project, I worked on a little bit of Front-End Development paired with some Back-End Development as well where I created the website that Emotify runs on and everything you see on it as well.
