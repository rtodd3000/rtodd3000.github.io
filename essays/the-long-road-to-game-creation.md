*Favorite game of all time: Overwatch… this game has inspired me to create games in the future and make a big AAA shooter with an existing company or make a popular indie game with a small group of people.*

Today I am presented with the question of what my interests in Software Engineering are and what skills and experiences I hope to gain in the future. However, before taking ICS 314 at UH Manoa (Software Engineering I), I had little to no knowledge of what Software Engineering was.
The only thing I knew about it, was that it is something involved in the process of Game Development, which is my dream job in the future. So, in order to figure that out, I had to research what Software Engineering is.

## What is Software Engineering?

“Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems.” as described by ChatGPT. 
I know that Software Engineering is also the reason we have video games, mobile applications, and more things that require a lot of depth and backing to them. Having the passion for developing video games, Software Engineering stands out as an essential skill to have for my future. 

Yet I ask myself, how long will the process of learning Software Engineering to the fullest take? After a quick google search I found that it takes people up to 4 years to gain the experience necessary to be a lead software engineer.

## Why I want to make video games

I want to make video games because they have the unique ability to immerse players in new worlds, tell compelling stories, and connect people through shared experiences. Games like Overwatch have inspired me by showing how design, teamwork, and creativity can come together to create something truly impactful. I want to be part of the process that brings these experiences to life, combining technical skills with artistic vision to create games that resonate with players worldwide.

Another dream of mine is to own my own studio that produces video games. Who knows, maybe one day this studio of mine might start producing AAA games in the future. All I know is that I want my games to really connect with the player and give them an escape from reality. Because for me, that’s what games have always been. Being the competitive person that I am, it also gives me a chance to challenge and prove myself. That accomplishment you feel from achieving a higher rank or finally beating a level/boss is irreplaceable after all.


## The skills and experiences I want to gain

The skills and experiences I want to gain in Software Engineering include learning how to design and implement efficient code, understanding software architecture, and mastering tools like version control systems and project management frameworks.

I also want to improve my teamwork and communication skills by collaborating with others to solve complex problems.I hope to gain a lot of experience in game development technologies such as game engines, graphics programming, and AI design, which will be crucial for my future in Game Development.

## My end goal with Software Engineering!

My ultimate goal with Software Engineering is to contribute to the creation of innovative and memorable games, whether by working for a renowned AAA game studio or by leading a small indie team to produce something unique. I aim to use my skills to push the boundaries of what games can achieve, creating experiences that inspire others, just as Overwatch has inspired me. By combining my passion for gaming with the technical knowledge and collaborative expertise I gain through this Software Engineering class and beyond, I hope to leave a lasting impact on the gaming industry.
