# Imagining the Painting
Common problems all artists run into is imagining their painting on a canvas. Starting from the beginning is the hardest part, and often requires a lot of imaginitivity. If all artists had no references and direction, then the canvas may be blank for hours! However, thanks to the design patterns of reusing different shapes, color combinations, etc, it allows them to paint their ideal painting to go from something like this:

to this! : 

This is a similar process to how software engineers can reuse templates such as the NextJs one below to give themselves a framework to start from. This way, all software engineers can achieve their ideal UI and backend functionality for any website, app, etc. that they see fit in the easiest way possible. However, much like painting, these "blueprints" will never make your whole creation for you. These design patterns just tell you the necessary components for a good painting/website.
in mind software engineers run into is thinking of a design for their websites. It should be intricate!

# Flowing the Brush with Direction
Your brush is the main component of your painting. You need one and only one brush to make this painting. Much like how React will apps allow you to maintain a central application-wide state in your website. Furthermore, good artists always keep a glass of water next to them to rinse off the brush and prepare for a new color to be added to the canvas. My brush in this instance would be the notification system in my code that will react to changes in the user data and apply them. 

# Shading
But what is a good painting without the shading on it as well? Otherwise, it would just be a plain jane canvas with contrasting colors that do not blend at all. The shaders in this case would be the API's that always give a response to match the modern interface of the deployed website. This ensures that my website is smoothly presenting all the user data that I need it to according to the design pattern!

# Final Touches
