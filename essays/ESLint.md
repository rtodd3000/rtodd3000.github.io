## Coding Standards: and the Demise of the Coder's Soul
Coding Standards are a guideline that has been well renowned within the coding community. They are meant to make code look cleaner and readable for other collaborators or people to look at. Although they reinforce good habits and provide long-term use, during this class it has almost become tedious to adhere to them. Especially for WODs, keeping a coding standard debugger's fixes like ESLints' in mind can be difficult.


# What is ESLint?
As touched on briefly, ESLint is a debugger extension tool in VSCode that is supposed to analyze your javascript/typescript code for issues and help you fix them. You do so by running the command "npm run lint" which uses the node package manager to run it. However, ESLint adheres to strict coding guidelines that can become frustrating at times.


# The Downfall of ESLint
For me, ESLint becomes very annoying to use for one reason, and one reason only. That being, the indentation errors that it gives you. I am haunted by this error because I am so used to pressing tab to indent my code but ESLint has a big issue with that. So I end up having to manually indent all of my code with spaces in order to get rid of the errors. Besides, I think ESLint is a good debugger for sticking to strict coding guidelines if that is what you're going for. However, for this class it has become more of a hindrance rather than a tool to utilize for my benefit. I hope to learn how to work around it so that I can eventually use it to its fullest.


# Final Thoughts
At the end of the day, there is a reason for these coding standards. They are meant to establish good practices in all programmers to make your code look silky smooth. I do not think they are useless at all, but for the sake of finishing things on time in this class, I may or may not take some shortcuts with the indentations especially. But, I will try my best to take notes from ESLint and apply these standards into my programs going forward.
