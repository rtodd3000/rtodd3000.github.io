# I. Introduction


AI has been a heavily debated tool in the world of Software Engineering and even education. Ever since the emergence of ChatGPT, its use in the educational world has been very controversial in regards to, essentially, giving students a "free pass" on homeworks, exams, and more. Critical thinking skills have diminished compared to before its existence because many students choose to heavily rely on AI to do their work for them. This became apparent to me in my <i>ICS 311 Algorithms</i> class because the homework scores compared to exam scores were completely off compared to the times before AI was popularized. Leading into Software Engineering, this tool has also been heavily utilized to solve difficult problems and even write whole code blocks for students.


# Personal Experience with AI


<strong>1. Experience WODs e.g. E18:</strong> For these WODs, I always tried to follow the instructions and attempted to finish the WOD myself before turning to AI. I would only turn to AI after I could not complete the first attempt in <i>Rx</i> timing. Firstly, I would review the screencast that detailed a completion of the WOD by an ICS 314 professor where I would then try to apply the new steps to my second attempt. If during the second attempt I could not complete the WOD on my own, I would turn to AI for some help. One instance of this for me was in the <strong><i>Digits</i></strong> assignment, where I had major issues with my database duplicating items. I remember specifically asking ChatGPT how this problem could be occurring in my database and was eventually able to fix it. Unfortunately, this came after the due date, since ChatGPT was not being very helpful when I was asking while I was originally doing the assignment. This goes to show that AI cannot solve all of your problems magically, and a basic understanding of what you are doing is crucial before asking AI for assistance.


<strong>2. In-Class Practice WODs:</strong> I never used AI on the in-class practice WODs because we were typically grouped up to work on them. I preferred to troubleshoot and solve problems with my teammate through our own knowledge and previous code that we had completed.


<strong>3. In-Class WODs:</strong> For these WODs, we were usually given an idea of what it was going to be prior to its starting date. An example of this was converting Ko-Hana-Rum to React for one of the WODs, which I admittedly used AI for. This was because a button was introduced that we needed to implement to be in the bottom right corner that will move up and down when you scroll on the page. For some reason, my button would just not scroll with the page and I had to turn to AI to try and fix the issue before the time was up. Since these WODs were graded on a timely basis, I would only attempt the problem for about 5-10 minutes on my own, where I would then turn to AI if I could not work fast enough.


<strong>4. Essays:</strong> I only used AI to get an idea of how to structure my ideas for my essay. I almost never took paragraphs/sentences that were written for me by AI, and only took the header formatting.


<strong>5. Final Project:</strong> AI was a big help for me on this project due to my inexperience using an API key to run scripts that categorize and pull data off of a spreadsheet/website. Along with this, working with so many variables in the prisma schema was very confusing for me at times. A lot of naming issues and fetching and assigning data to a user from a specific variable required a lot of attention to detail. Since I was also overloaded with work from my other classes, I used AI for almost all of my code on this project. It ended up saving me a lot of time and taught me a lot more about how databases, APIs, and schema's work in more depth than I knew before.


<strong>6. Learning a concept / tutorial:</strong> I think the only time I ever used AI to learn in this class was when we were asked questions about the differences between javascript and typescript, what is react, etc. Furthermore, I also used it to learn how to set up PgAdmin4 and prisma because I felt that the online instructions were a little hard to follow.


<strong>7. Answering a question in class or in Discord:</strong> Answering someone's question via AI does not come off right to me, so I never decided to use it for that reason. In class, however, I used it to answer questions from the professor that I just detailed in question 6.


<strong>8. Asking or answering a smart-question:</strong> AI was never utilized by me in this area because I only responded to classmates' questions if I actually knew an in-depth answer to it. Otherwise, I would leave it up to someone else to answer them. For asking a smart question, I would just use my own words to describe what issue I was having.


<strong>9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”:</strong> I only did this for my final project to write some of my API routes. Posting, getting, and deleting were things I was unfamiliar with, and since I wanted to learn how to make those types of files, I asked for some examples from ChatGPT.


<strong>10. Explaining code:</strong> I only did this for my final project to write some of my API routes. Posting, getting, and deleting were things I was unfamiliar with, and since I wanted to learn how to make those types of files, I asked for some examples from ChatGPT.


<strong>11. Writing Code:</strong> AI carried the brunt of my work on most of my WODs and the Final Project. It was a tool I turned to a lot in this class.


<strong>12. Documenting code:</strong> I never asked AI to specifically document my code, rather, it would already write comments on its own when writing code for me. One issue I did have with AI was the omission of my comments throughout my code, which I had to specify for it to not delete them.


<strong>13. Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here></code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here></code here>”:</strong> I relied on the command <i>npm run lint:fix</i> to fix all of my lint errors. In my previous experiences, AI is not good at fixing lint errors so I stuck to my own knowledge on the matter. For quality assurances in my code, I would frequently ask AI these types of questions during my final project.


<strong>14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed:</strong> I explained all of the ways I utilized AI to my benefit in this class already.


# III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:


For me, AI has always been like a double-edged sword in this class. It is very good at helping me comprehend and understand topics I was still unfamiliar with, but it also inhibited my skills to code assignments completely on my own without asking it for help. Thankfully, I would say that the benefits definitely outweigh the negatives in the aspect of teaching me to write simple, clean code. There are multiple ways to solve certain problems in the programming world, which is why I love coding so much. There is not a single approach you HAVE to take, encouraging more creativity than you would see in classes like Chemistry or Math.


# IV. Practical Applications


Similar to the screencasts, a lot of coding examples and solutions to problems can be outdated or slower than the newer ways to complete the task. AI is very helpful in updating this code to be more concise, modern, and/or catered towards your specific liking. For instance, when I was making a game for my <i>ICS 485: Game Development</i> class, a lot of the videos on making a climbing script for a 3D character in Unity were old or not to my preferences. Therefore, I would take the base of the code that I gathered from the videos and ask AI to add certain elements that fit the climbing style I wanted for my character.


# V. Challenges and Opportunities:


The challenges I underwent using AI mostly lied in the wording of my questions and requests. Sometimes, I would get repeated code that I said did not work already or would get an answer to my question that was completely irrelevant to what I wanted. I think in this regard, teaching students in software engineering education how to ask questions to AI would be very helpful and insightful to use it in a way that is not redundant. Along with this, I think showcasing examples of overutilization AI would assist students in preventing the use of it in ways that does not improve their education on Software Engineering concepts.


# VI. Comparative Analysis:


If I did not exist while I took this class, I think that it would have been a lot more challenging. As mentioned previously, I used AI to write a lot of my code for my final project, which I believe is supposed to showcase <strong>YOUR OWN</strong> skills that you gained taking this class. Watching screencasts is a good alternative to using AI, but besides that I did not have a good method that taught me how to code effectively. Reading online documentation and textbooks to learn how to code is not helpful for me, so I turned to AI when the screencasts did not provide much insight for me. I can imagine that the students that took this class before AI was introduced have had a clearer retention and better skill development over the years compared to me.


# VII. Future Considerations:


As we know, AI is an ever growing tool that is being implemented across all areas of Software Engineering and Computer Science education as a whole. It is inevitable that it will be used in an educational <strong><i>AND</i></strong> professional setting. The important part is that we as students learn how to write standard code ourselves rather than relying completely on AI to do this for us. AI can easily write code to solve simple tasks, so if that is our only area of expertise, we risk the reality of not landing a job in our designated field. Our focus might have to shift to other areas of Software Engineering such as framework and algorithmic designs. This way, students are learning how to do things that AI cannot do so easily, aiding us with knowledge that <strong><i>CAN</i></strong> assist students with obtaining a well-paying job.


# VIII. Conclusion:


My time in ICS 314 was a long, grueling, yet very educating one. AI has shown countless times that it can be a powerful and convenient tool for undergraduate developers. However, the important takeaway is to not over utilize its power, or else you risk a diminishing retention and engagement of software engineering concepts. Having AI being pushed to be used so frequently in this class was almost a bit of a bad influence, as it made students think that relying on it heavily was ok. Almost like being peer pressured into using it. Therefore, going forward in Software Engineering education, I would love to see more restrictions on its use for specific assignments that teach students important concepts of the course. Along with this, including more material on how to properly and safely use it would help students not over-rely on it. That way, students can build the necessary foundational skills all software engineers require outside of the use of AI.
