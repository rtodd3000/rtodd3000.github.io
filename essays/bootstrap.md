Going from one ice cream place to another, you start to notice that one Vanilla is sweeter and harder than the other, or one chocolate is richer than the other. All of the different shops have differing textures and flavors amongst each other for each of their flavors. However, one thing stays consistent all around: SOFT SERVE! 

Much like soft serve ice cream, UI Frameworks also pride themselves on a smooth consistency that allows for faster development times and consistent pre-built components. But, what is a framework??
Here's what I think: the difficult things will always be difficult.

## What are UI Frameworks?

A UI Framework is defined as a collection of pre-made tools, templates, and code libraries that assist the developer in making a user interface. Typically, these are used by web developers to make interactive websites where the user can click on buttons, dropdown menus, and more. 

Some popular UI Frameworks used in web development include React, Bootstrap, etc. that include these things for the developer to utilize. However, learning some of these can be as difficult as learning a new coding language so why learn them?

## Soft-Serve is easy to look at and taste, but requires mastery:
Making just a website with CSS and HTML is very simple, but the simpleness of it is something not many people strive for. Just like Soft-Serve is enjoyed by many, it is enjoyed for its simple, yet diverse flavor and texture. A lot of people like interactivity and want their websites to shine rather than be dull and boring. Take these two websites for example:

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Although they both look nice and have the build of a website, one is static and does not let the user interact with it, while the other lets the user navigate through the entire website. One was made with html and css, whilst the other was made with bootstrap. My personal experience with bootstrap has been a difficult learning process with many different column/row alignments, but I have found it very helpful in designing websites that I think people will enjoy in the long run.

## UI and Soft-Serve are not so different!

So, just like soft-serve ice cream is enjoyed by many, UI Frameworks are too! By developers and users around the world, both gain the enjoyment of making/enjoying something that is simple, yet so complex. No matter how hard I struggle with learning Bootstrap, I know that it is something that I want to do to be a great software developer in the future.
