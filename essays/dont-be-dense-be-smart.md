# What is a Smart Question?
Starting the journey of becoming a full fledged Software Engineer is no easy task and you are bound to encounter some roadblocks along the way. What determines your success in overcoming them lies in how, where, and when you ask your coding questions. These questions should be formatted as **Smart** questions, which are described as precise, clear, and straight to the point. Along with this, your question should be one that you were not able to solve with prior effort, this way you can encourage collaboration, get clear answers, and gain and provide knowledge to others who had the same questions as you at the same time..
Jumping to ask questions with no clarity and hundreds of lines of code leads to confusion and vague answers. By analyzing two examples from a trusted site such as Stack Overflow, we can see the differences between a Smart and not so Smart question.


## Smart Question 
**Question:** [Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array)
<br />**How is it Smart:** Not only is the question very straightforward, but the user also provided examples of their code in Java and C++ and explained their thought process and steps that led to their confusion. They explained how sorting the data in C++ made the code run in 1.93 seconds, while not sorting it made it run in 11.93 seconds, the java code gave similar results.
<br />**Results:** After looking at a couple of the responses given for this question, I found that a lot of the answers were concise and used real-life analogies to help other users understand the concept of why sorted arrays process faster than unsorted ones.
Furthermore, the result of such a good question was a big upvote from the community with 27,407 upvotes and 25 very detailed answers, each providing different angles and insights to the question. 


## Not-So-Smart Question
**Question:** [Issue with downloading file via Browser-use](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79384448/issue-with-downloading-file-via-browser-use)
<br />**How is it not Smart**: Not only is the question very broad and general, but their description of their troubles shows no signs of effort to fix it themselves. They just describe how they wrote web-automation to download a file by browser-use tool, but that it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Afterwards they just pasted their entire code and assumed the issue was one of two lines, displaying the lack of effort in resolving the issue themselves. This violates the entire premise of a Smart question to begin with and the guidelines of Stack Overflow.
<br />**Results:** Only one person responded to this question and they were generous enough to provide what they thought were the lines of code that needed to be fixed, yet the user who posted the question never follows up and says if it worked or not. Along with this, there was no explanation behind the answer, just a straightforward: "This is your issue". As a result, nobody will be able to learn from this and only provides a solution to the problem without any understanding of why your code was wrong in the first place.

## Stop being Dense!
After reviewing a Smart and a not Smart question, the difference between the two is night and day. Developers around the world are constantly learning new things and want to challenge themselves to improve day by day. By evaluating the smart question, we see that many other developers appreciated and contributed to learning and teaching more about a simple concept in programming that will help the user who asked it in the first place, as well as any other people who had the same question or confusion surrounding its answer. The not smart question leaves us in the dark, wondering how the answer was found and why it is the solution. Furthermore, the question itself shows a lack of trial and error which goes against everything a software developer should be in the first place. 

<br />Collaboration is key in the programming world and so is trial and error to receive concise and quicker solution responses. So stop being dense and ask smart questions, it is a necessity!
