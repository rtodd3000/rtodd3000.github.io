## Overview
The Problem: 31% of students at UH Manoa are out of state with 8% being international. For many of these students, it is their first time in Hawaii and they have no idea what there is to do around campus and in the state itself. Simply searching for things on google maps can take time, and often leads to minimal activities to do. Unfortunately, this leads to students having a lack of things to do and leads to increased stress and feelings of isolation.

The Solution: Manoa Compass is a web application that students attending UH Manoa can log in to with their school email and make a profile that has their interests, major, where they're from, and housing and transportation situation. Using AI, we will create a To-Do list for this incoming student to get the full experience of Hawaii catered to their profile. This will allow for the student to discover their favorite spots on the island and activities to do while they are going to school here.
