# I. How did you make your effort estimates?
Effort estimates were always made based upon my own abilities. I will admit, my skills were very surface level prior to working on this project. All I knew about doing this project was making front-end things look very clean and formatted via Bootstrap and React components. Along with this, utilizing the prisma database was also a commonality I was familiar with thanks to assignments <strong>Digits</strong> and <strong>Bowfolios</strong>. Yet, this was never a deep understanding of databases, as I was more focused on getting the assignments done rather than truly learning how to utilize them. Therefore, I always tried to ask myself two things: <br>
1. Can I do this without <i>ChatGPT?</i>
2. Do I have the time to do this in one sitting?

If the answer to both of them was no, I would make sure to have a minimum of 2-3 hours to complete my issue. On the other hand, if it was yes, I would have a maximum of 1 hour and 30 minutes to complete it. Typically, it ended up being the former, so I had a lot of high effort estimations, ranging from 2-4 hours.


# II. Effort Estimation Planning Benefits
To me, effort estimations served to be time limits for myself. If I could complete the issue within the self-assigned time, then I was succeeding as a Software Engineer. Even if I went way over the time, it still gave me a benchmark to go by and see if I actually had the ability to meet it. Looking at the effort estimations in this way made me see the benefits, otherwise, it really did not do much for me. Effort estimations became unnecessary to me towards the finalization of Manoa Compass because of the frustrations and difficulties I was experiencing with learning about AI scripts and our database as a whole.

# III. Effort Estimation Tracking Benefits
When it comes to tracking these set estimations, I saw it as nothing more than a chore at times, being more concerned with the quality and correctness of my code rather than finishing it in a set time. The in-class WODs definitely accustomed me to these "timed" coding sessions, but for this final project I wanted to make sure I not only did it correctly, but also <b>understood</b> what I was doing. I used AI heavily in both the WODs and this final project, so ensuring I understand the changes and code AI writes for me is crucial for my future as a Software Engineer. 


# III. Tracking my Effort
I tracked my effort using the VSCode timer extension that tracks your time spent coding in VSCode from the moment you open the application. Unfortunately, Since I often never closed VSCode, I was left to estimate the time I actually spent coding my issues and the time I spent researching/using AI for help. The timer does not stop until you close it, leaving a massive time such as 10-12 hours when I was ready to finally close it for the day. Oftentimes, the issues I was working on took me an immense amount of time to complete due to frustrations with the schema variables' naming conflicts. For instance, in Milestone 2, I had a major problem where my issues were to setup the profile and sign-up process of our website. Everything was working in a reasonable time of 4 hours, <i>(2 hours for each problem)</i>, but my group members informed me that I was using the old schema. Unfortunately, this meant I had to do it all over again with the new schema variables. It was a quick, but very unnecessary conflict that I put myself through. Thankfully, I never had to go through this again and my actual effort timing would usually always match up to my estimates. 


# IV. Overhead in Effort Tracking
Personally, the overhead in my experience was at a medium level. It never got to the point where I was unable to work on the project, but it was definitely tedious at times. As mentioned earlier, I almost always forgot to stop the timer to track my work and had to guess a lot on how long each of my issues actually took me to complete. Furthermore, making an estimate always took me a good 20-30 minutes to make sure I was making something reasonable for myself according to my own ability. In the end, I am thankful for the benefits it provided me and do think it can be a useful component of a Software Engineering project, <strong><i>ONLY</strong></i> if it is as minimal in work as it was for this class.
